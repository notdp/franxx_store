# FRANXX Wiki (Concise Reference)

> Note: This page summarizes worldbuilding elements from “DARLING in the FRANXX” for naming and thematic references in this project. It avoids heavy plot spoilers while staying conceptually accurate.

## Overview
FRANXX are human-made biomechanical weapons created under Dr. FRANXX (Werner Frank) to fight Klaxosaurs. Each unit is piloted by a male–female pair (Stamen and Pistil) via neural synchronization. The APE organization governs production, deployment, and operations.

## Piloting & Sync
- Dual-pilot system: Stamen (male) + Pistil (female), distinct postures and interfaces.
- Neural link: stable connection is required; pair compatibility caps usable sync intensity.
- Sync metric (Paracapacity): proxy for compatibility and performance ceiling.
- Uniform marks: inverted “Y” for Stamen; “X” for Pistil.

### Special Mode: Stampede
- Trigger: abnormal scenarios such as Pistil-only piloting.
- Effect: feral/unstable behavior with severe strain on the Pistil.
- Implication: emergency-only; prolonged usage is dangerous.

## Units & Lineup
### Squad 13 (flower-themed)
- Strelizia — ace melee unit
  - Pilots: Zero Two (002, Pistil) × Hiro (016, Stamen)
  - Traits: iconic high-mobility/high-output platform; base for later evolutions.
- Delphinium — commander-oriented melee
  - Pilots: Ichigo × Goro
  - Traits: balanced control; excels at close-quarters command.
- Argentea — scout melee
  - Pilots: Miku × Zorome
  - Traits: agile recon with burst capability.
- Genista — siege artillery
  - Pilots: Kokoro × Futoshi
  - Traits: long-range support and suppression.
- Chlorophytum — ranged fire support
  - Pilots: Ikuno × Mitsuru
  - Traits: fire cover and multipurpose support.

### Standard (mass-production) FRANXX
- Industrial, standardized units optimized for scale and replacement.

### 9 Model / Nines
- Special models operated by APE elites (e.g., Nine Alpha). Styling and interfaces differ; many specifics are revealed progressively in canon.

## Evolved Forms (light spoilers)
- Strelizia Apus
  - Summary: advanced form of Strelizia with higher mobility and configurable armaments.
- True Apus (final form)
  - Summary: ultimate evolution deployed against higher-tier threats in key battles.

## Technology & Setting
- Biomechanical fusion: Klaxosaur-derived tissues integrated with advanced alloys.
- Energy: Magma Energy as strategic power source.
- Society & infrastructure:
  - Plantation: mobile fortress-cities for production and habitation.
  - Birdcage: training/boarding facilities for Parasites.
  - APE: ruling body controlling resources and military directives.

## Parasites (Pilots)
- Selection: adolescents with fertility; must pass compatibility/adaptability tests.
- Training: from fundamentals and sync adaptation to tactical cooperation.
- Identification: numerical codes (e.g., 002, 016) for internal governance.

## Combat & Tactics
- Core tasks: defend Plantations, escort energy logistics, conduct expeditions.
- Teamwork: Squad 13’s roles are complementary across recon, melee, artillery, and support.

## Symbols & Themes
- Floral naming: life, growth, and bonds between pilots.
- Gender imagery: Stamen/Pistil echo botanical reproduction, reinforcing “paired sync”.

## Quick Glossary
- FRANXX: biomechanical weapon system.
- Stamen / Pistil: male/female pilot roles.
- Paracapacity: sync compatibility metric.
- Plantation / Birdcage: mobile city / boarding facility.
- Klaxosaur: primary adversaries.
- Magma Energy: strategic energy source.
- Nines: elite special-model unit group.

Future extensions: detailed weapon lists per unit, timeline, relationship maps, and event arcs (bilingual) can be added as needed.
